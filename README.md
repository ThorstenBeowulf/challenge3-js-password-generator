# Javascript Password Generator

## Goals

The main goal of this project was to implement a simple random password generator in javascript that will give a random string of characters.
The project uses a html webpage for user input and output with a linked javascript file for the logic.

## Features

The app takes user input for the length of the string and which sets of characters to use via pop-up prompts and the result is displayed in an output box in the middle of the page.

- Characters selectable from 4 categories (lower case, upper case, numbers 0-9 and special characters).
- Checks for password min and max length.
- Displays descriptive messages in output box if password generation failed for some reason.
